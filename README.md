# avail doc testing
 
## Description
We tried to deploy an Arbitrum Orbit L3 with Avail as the DA layer by following the documentation here (https://docs.availproject.org/docs/build-with-avail/Optimium/arbitrum-nitro/nitro-stack). We have successfully deployed an Arbitrum Orbit L3, but there are some improvements that can be added to the documentation. See [here](https://github.com/zt-9/avail-doc-testing/blob/main/avail%20with%20arbitrum%20orbit.md?plain=1) for issues and improvements.

## How it's made
The deployment has used Arbitrum Orbit and Avail as the DA layer. We have also used the docker image provided by Avail. First we deployed the rollup contracts to Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, then we started the chain with the Docker image and successfully had the block explorer running.
